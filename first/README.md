My first look at <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> 

Live demo: https://martinelfast.github.io/

I can see a very broad scope of usecases for this framework, especially combined with some shader magic.

Its JavaScript/browser based, which is very attractive, no installation required and its cross platform.

Potential to make some interactive and visually amazing web design
